## Cool datasets
* [Repository of miscellaneous datasets](https://cooldatasets.com/)
* [More miscellaneous datasets, including very large ones](https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/)
* [GitHub list of public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
    - [World Database of Happiness](https://www.worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/trendnat/framepage.htm)
    - [US General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/pages/show?page=gss%2Fgss_data)
    - More stuff: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
* [NASA Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/)
    * [VEMAP 1: Georeferencing](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/VEMAP-1-Georeferencing/6j3t-gxbn): An integrated input data set for ecosystem and vegetation modeling for the conterminous United States: Georeferencing
    * [Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1220567914-USGS_LTA.html): The VegDRI calculations integrate satellite-based observations of vegetation conditions, climate data, and other biophysical information such as land cover/land use type, soil characteristics, and ecological setting. The VegDRI maps that are produced deliver continuous geographic coverage over large areas, and have inherently finer spatial detail (1-km2 resolution) than other commonly available drought indicators such as the U.S. Drought Monitor.
